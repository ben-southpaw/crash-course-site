    <h1>Time and Habits</h1>
    <h2> <em></em></h2>
    <h3></h3>
    
    <p>Given that I am, as of this moment, still working on an assignment due last night, my time managment skills could do with a polish to say the least. After readng through a few of the resources what I found most interesting was the obvious one, the Pomodoro technique. Although the merits of this seem valid, I can also imagine the technique drastically failing without decent self-discipline and can imagine those breaks being stretched out and problems being lingered on. However, despite this I am hoping to prove these doubts very wrong.

    Another interesting concept that I hope to employ is 'Flow'. For this I can imagine finding motivational factors is key to produce this state but once achieved the positive reinforcement of enjoying learning sounds great!

    One technique that I did try was using mindfullness, I have the Headspace app and am a big fan. Really helps to put things in perspective when stressed which can in turn make you end up being more productive.

    The 'Create a Habit' video has stuck with me somewhat and going forward I hope to create habits that are both productive and rewarding.
