 <h3>How did 'process over product' affect the way I tackled the website redesign and rebuild?</h3>
    <p style= "color: black;">It didn't have too much of an effect on me as I was struggling with the processes anyway. However, I could see how easy it could be to get stuck on simple design features or minor details. Also I can see how doing things this way is the most effective way of learning the tools implemented.

<h3>What did I think about meditation before reading chapter 2?</h3>
    <p style="color: black;">I was quite aware of a few different aspects of meditation and have done an entry midfulness course before. However the video was still very informative and knowing that meditation is about practice means that a reminder is equally useful. The new things that I did learn about meditation are the theories around happiness, not just seeking a calm or a productive state but how restting the mind can default to happiness. Furthermore, the neurological evidence for mindfulness was intriguing. How exactly the process works seems a mystery but having a greater immune response seems great. The techniques that stood out to me were simply the mindfulness breathing techniques suggested, these were being championed pretty strongly. Also, the sitting techniques that are ok and those that might not be so good.</p>
