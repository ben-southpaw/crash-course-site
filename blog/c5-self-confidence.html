 <h3>What is the relationship between mindfulness and self-awarenss?</h3>
    <p style= "color: black;">In chapter 4, these two are stated as being essentially the same thing. Self-awareness can also lead to a greater sense of self-confidence which may help to maintain mindfulness practice as well. Furthermore, basic mindfulness practices are suggested to help develop a greater sense of self-awareness but other practices such as the body scan or journalling are suggested to be even more potent.
    </p>

<h3>Body Scan. What was the experience and how did it feel?</h3>
    <p style="color: black;">The experience was pretty interesting, I didn't follow the exact instructions of the chapter but felt that this was ok given there aren't really any rules. Calming the mind was difficult given the busy week and schedule but happened eventually. The sensations were quite apparent the longer the scan went on and I slept well that evening for sure.</p>

<h3>'My emotions are not me'<"/h3>
  <p style="color: black;">The idea of this section, that we are disconnected from our emotions is quite interesting. Suggesting that emotions are a stray from our actual selves. The idea is that with mindful practice we can learn to almost observe these changes in ourselves from the third person. This gives us more control and objectivity over the situation. Being less reactive and instinctive like this would help to remain calm under stress I think!</p>
