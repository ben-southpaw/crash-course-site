 <h3>What learnings did you take from the chapter?</h3>
    <p style= "color: black;">I found the concepts of emotional intelligence and to be interesting. However, understanding the facets within emotional intelligence doesn't directly aid us with exhibiting these traits i.e the so what question. If someone is motivated by these principles and qualities I think they could be useful and somewhat powerful. To be honest, I find myself being sceptical about anything that has broad sweeping claims but the best way to critique these is probably through experiencing what is being promoted.

<h3>How did you find the two minutes of mindfulness?</h3>
    <p style="color: black;"> I enjoyed the break for a number of reasons. Firstly, it is quite refreshing for the task that needs to be done is counter-intuitively asking us to relax and slow down. Not judging was something that feels unnatural given we are constantly assessing our situation whether we are cognitively in the present or not. </p>
