 <h3>How does life look through the 'pleasure, passion and purpose' lens?</h3>
    <p style= "color: black;">This I think refers to the nature of happiness being somewhat contagious. If people are passionate about what the and feel a sense of purpose, they are likely to be happier in their working environment. This will lead to work not being considered work and hopefully lead to a shared enthusiasm of this view and to a state of flow.

<h3>What are your core values?</h3>
    <p style="color: black;">I found that my core values involve several things I hope I am already doing and a couple I am not. I will only cover a couple. Firstly, one value is to treat others with respect, knowing that you do not know their story or state and that you could be in their shoes one day as well. Another is a need for experience and life. A value I have for myself is to never sell myself short, that taking opportunities is very important along with the gratitude for those opportunities.</p>

<h3>What do you stand for?</h3>
  <p style="color: black;">I'm not sure what it is that I stand for but I do think that people should base their life goals and efforts around improving the lives of others and enjoy the consequences of those actions. However, this leaves a lot of room for variation but thats ok.</p>
  

  

<h3>How did you find the resilience ideas and meditation exercise?</h3>
    <p style="color: black;">To be honest, with resilience it felt like a certain circular logic was being pushed. The writings seem to state that once you could overcome your emotions by using mindfulness you would develop emotional resilience. This seems a bit unhelpful in that addressing issues that are deeply ingrained in reality tend to draw people away from their ability to concentrate fully or find time to do relaxing activites such as mindfulness. However, the point I think was that once mindfulness becomes a larger part of your life these types of issues being much more manageable; they can be viewed from a rationale of cognitive resilience and dealt with and separated via emotional resilience. However, the exercise and ideas that failures are very important to success were good and relatable. I think responding to failure appropriately is something everyone would love to improve. Maintaining the mental discipline to use mindfulness in those situations I think is the hardest part.</p>
