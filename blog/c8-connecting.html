 <h3>Have you tried using any of the insight and techniques for growing trust and sincerity? How did it go?</h3>
    <p style= "color: black;">I haven't really got any examples that I have initiated in recent times but the question does make me think of something. I work with someone whose name I didn't even know until recently despite spending a decent amount of time working together, however I think of this person as trustworthy and sincere. Part of this is due to that he is a great listener and is always smiling. Because I feel there is mutual trust, there also feels no unease about silence or the manner in which we demand things of each other.
    </p>

<h3>Try empathic listening - how did it go?</h3>
    <p style="color: black;">This went well at first but the person I was sharing the conversation with did not wish to open up much. However, I can see the value of this practice.</p>

<h3>How did you find the loving kindness meditation?</h3>
  <p style="color: black;">It was a generally pleasant experience. I felt a little distracted during the first two minute breath exercise but this was a good way to get focussed.</p>
  

  

<h3>Political Awareness Exercise</h3>
    <p style="color: black;">
    The situation I refer to is about a former flatmate who I felt abused the trust of the others and acted in a somehwat selfish manner across many areas. He often neglected to do his part in terms of cleaning, contributing a fair share to bills and was socially non-involved most of the time. I tried to foster good relations through offering invites to events, to cook him food or donate things I had, which he might appreciate. All of this was, in my view, taken advantage of and unappreciated.</p>
    <p style="color: black;">
    From the perspective of the flatmate I can see someone thinking that if no one explicitly states there is a problem there is no problem. Also if I have a poor memory how am I to blame for forgetting simple things, my intentions were to do the right thing. Lastly, people shouldn't expect anything in return for what they offer as thats not a genuine offer really!</p>
