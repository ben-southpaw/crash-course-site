<h2>Problem One</h2>

 <h3>What was the problem?</h3>
    <p style= "color: black;">Slowly crawling through the codecademy JavaScript course.
    </p>

<h3>What type of problem solving techniques did you use?</h3>
    <p style="color: black;"> Using the Q & A feature provided was useful when no the method of simplying 'trying something' failed. Moreover, a lot of googling occurred and lead to a couple of distracting rabbit holes and some success and but mostly additional confusion. Reading the error messages provided was most useful and often it was an error not worth sweating over such a basic syntax error from a missing colon or comma. I should have asked peers for help but felt that it wasn't worth distracting them.</p>

<h3>How did you feel throughout the process?</h3>
  <p style="color: black;">Quite irritated at points but also impatient. Occasionally the frustration lead me to miss important details on the next task, leading to basic errors.</p>
  

  

<h3>What did you learn?</h3>
    <p style="color: black;">That often there is a simple solution and re-reading or taking a step back to think about the problem is more effective than getting flustered and searching too deep for the answer. Also that the pace of codecademy might not suit my learning style.</p>

<h2>Problem Two</h2>

 <h3>What was the problem?</h3>
    <p style= "color: black;">Completing the js racer exercise for this course.
    </p>

<h3>What type of problem solving techniques did you use?</h3>
    <p style="color: black;"> Initially I set out to google the issue on a broad scope. That is trying to find a magic solution that would help to create the game. Very quickly I realised that breaking the challenge down into smaller sections was important. The 'rubber ducky' technique was also a good place to get ideas from. However, the best help came from asking friends and peers for help. Little techniques and examples lead to decent progress and the challenge wasn't so intimidating anymore as it was optional to make it complex or not now!</p>

<h3>How did you feel throughout the process?</h3>
  <p style="color: black;">Very frustrated and hopeless initially. I knew it would happen and that eventually the task be over but it impacted my enjoyment of the other material and just generally wasn't enjoyable to focus on.</p>

<h3>What did you learn?</h3>
    <p style="color: black;">Once I had given up hope of achieving the task solo, I realised it was best to learn what I could from the process and seek help with it. However, accepting to learn from the frustration in terms of learning info and technique to tackle a challenge was important. I also learned that pseudocode is best applied within your skillset as a tool. Moreover, relflection on the exercise help to solidify all these ideas and brought a tiny bit of confidence going forward.</p>

    <h2>.map()</h2>
<p style="color: black;">This is a method that creates a new array based on a previously applied callback function which is applied to each element of a previously established array.</p>

    <h2>.filter()</h2>
<p style="color: black;">This method does a similar thing to .map() in that a callback function is applied to each element within an array. The difference is that the new array created is only from the elements which pass the test by the earlier called function. It functions to erase elements that dont withstand certain criteria.</p>

    <h2>.reduce()</h2>
<p style="color: black;">This also follows suit in applying a callback function to each element in an array to create a new array. The difference is the cumulative value observed from the function is then appended to the initial variable.</p>
