 <h3>What is a responsive website?</h3>
    <p style= "color: black;">A responsive website is one that essentially looks the same on a number of devices. Not exactly the same in terms of the size and design but more feels the same and presents information similarly and efficiently. This is important as mentioned last week that the increasingly tech savvy population is accessing the web on smaller screens more and more.
    </p>

<h3>Why is mobile first design important?</h3>
    <p style="color: black;">As mentioned above with the direction of web access going cellular, developers are being forced to reduce their content. Also the nature of the screens means the designs appear linear with links harder to access. Some might consider this a good thing with a straightforward hierarchy of important content being fed top to bottom.</p>

<h3>What are frameworks?</h3>
  <p style="color: black;">Frameworks are reusable website models or tools where some of the coding work is already set and less needs to be coded for the HTML, Java or CSS tp be used by a developer. Popular examples of these include <ol>
    <li>Bootstrap</li>
    <li>Foundation</li>
    <li>Wirefy</li>
    <li>Skeleton</li>
  </ol>
  The benefits</p>
