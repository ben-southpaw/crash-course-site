 <h3>What is a responsive website?</h3>
    <p style= "color: black;">A responsive website is one that essentially looks the same on a number of devices. Not exactly the same in terms of the size and design but more feels the same and presents information similarly and efficiently. This is important as mentioned last week that the increasingly tech savvy population is accessing the web on smaller screens more and more.
    </p>

<h3>Why is mobile first design important?</h3>
    <p style="color: black;">As mentioned above with the direction of web access going cellular, developers are being forced to reduce their content. Also the nature of the screens means the designs appear linear with links harder to access. Some might consider this a good thing with a straightforward hierarchy of important content being fed top to bottom.</p>

<h3>What are frameworks?</h3>
  <p style="color: black;">Frameworks are reusable website models or tools where some of the coding work is already set and less needs to be coded for the HTML, Java or CSS tp be used by a developer. Popular examples of these include <ol>
    <li>Bootstrap</li>
    <li>Foundation</li>
    <li>Wirefy</li>
    <li>Skeleton</li>
  </ol>
  The benefits include saving time and this in turns often equates to saving money for yourself or your client. Also as large communities use frameworks an added layer of security is present as others are constantly testing the framework for its reliability. The downside to this is that by using this, you may be prevented from actually learning the language you are working with. Furthermore, each framework will have a series of limitations that will restrict high;y creative developers and the code is also public meaning you could be open to higher scrutiny.</p>

  <h3>What is a wireframe an why use it?</h3>
    <p style="color: black;">A wireframe is a basic outlay of a website. One can be hand-drawn or created in a program. The use is to give an idea of what the final product hopes to look like. This can help give direction for orchestrating what goes where on a website. Wireframes provide a vital link for projects involving multiple people. Those working on back-end can understand  what is needed while front-end can theorise what is possible and neccessary design-wise.</p>
