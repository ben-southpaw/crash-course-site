<h2>How would you use...</h2>

 <h3>parentheses ()</h3>
    <p style= "color: black;">Any content within these will be an expression or a parameter. The contents are to be passed to functions and any equations are then executed. Otherwise, the contents will be used to surround conditional statements. Alternatively, parentheses could control structures in terms of the order of operations, similarly to the order used in maths. 
    </p>

<h3>Brackets []</h3>
    <p style="color: black;">These brackets are used to house the properties of an Object or the elements of an Array in most cases. The properties and elements can then be accessed through being called or via 'console.log'.</p>

<h3>Braces {}</h3>
  <p style="color: black;">Braces can be used for functions, Objects and also loops. They can be used to combine a set of statements in a block or to create Objects via the Object Literal notation.</p>
  

  

<h3>Single '' or Double Quotes ""</h3>
    <p style="color: black;">While there is some chatter about the preferences amongst web developers, there seems to be no functional difference between the two options. Some reasons for using single include only needing to press a single key and less visual clutter. However, by virtue double quotes are more visible when going over code. Some languages might feature slight differences in terms of how they are used but when it comes to JavaScript they are essentially the same.</p>
