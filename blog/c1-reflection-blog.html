    <p>It seems the EDA experience/experiment is one of constant change. While this could be viewed as inconsistant and unstable compared to a traditional schooling system, as Shareef notes the tech world works differently. EDA appears to attempt to hack into the psyche of an ideal and efficent learning model via the kitchen/restaurant metaphor.

    My impressions of the EDA model so far are extremely limited and I don't think a fair evaulation will be possible until after the bootcamp. However, the ideas of independent learning while sharing knowledge with other and re-evaluating what is means to be a student really appeals!

    I see myself fully engaging with this, an am excited to put in my two cents along with getting out a whole heap of knowledge. I think the pressure and length of time spent with others will create a special bond to help induce our creative selves alongside a breadth of technical knowledge.

    My expectations of EDA have changed since last monday, the challenge is real aha.

    Like most I feel equal amounts of nerves and excitement!
