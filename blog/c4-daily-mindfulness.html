 <h3>What was learnt from my mindful conversation?</h3>
    <p style= "color: black;">My conversation was had over lunch and definitely felt a little awkward but it was interesting and the pauses and responses felt more considered. I guess I found that there was a rush to give opinion and this was difficult to supress. The person I was talking with found it a little funny, I think, as they asked if I was ok on two occasions. It seems like a good practice though and worth developing as a habit for some occasions.

<h3>Which of the three techniques will be best to sustain practice?</h3>
    <p style="color: black;">Having a buddy seems like the best way to sustain mindful activities. Just getting feedback and having a tiny bit of pressure to help to encourage you feels like it would work to build habits. Hoewever, I do also like the single breath per day idea but this could easily be incorporated to having a buddy as well!</p>

<h3>Other musings...</h3>
  <p style="color: black;">While mindful listening seems to be the main practice for enhancing mindfulness, I found looping to be an interesting concept. Giving feedback both ways wont always happen but it really lets one party know that listening is happening and attention is being given.
  What I am slightly unsure about in relation to the 'looping' technique is whether or not it is worth explicitly stating to each other what is happening. That is whether being conscious of the techniques would affect the outcome. The formal format feels a little but plastic but maybe its worth trying before judging. Moreover, 'dipping' sounded like a self-awareness technique that would be difficult to get into the habit of. It would be great to have the patients to constantly reflect on the goings on in conversation but often the fast pace of social activity makes it difficult so this one I think is about finding the right space to practive this.</p>
