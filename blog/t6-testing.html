 <h3>What is scope?</h3>
    <p style= "color: black;">Within JavaScript scope refers to where the current code is occurring; its current context. So if a certain function effects all of the code, this might be referred to as global scope. If the code isn't global it has local scope. One example could be if we are writing a small piece of code within a function, the scope of this code will only effect the way the function works, so that is the extent of our current scope.

    Being able to understand the scope of the code being written is highly important to avoid bugs and maintain some cohesion. the default scope when beginning, is global. That means any new instructions or variables written will effect the remainder of whats to come unless otherwise specified. Further specifications such as new non-globallt written functions are then local scope. Items of code written within these only interact with code or variables of the same level of scope. This code become invisible to everything that takes place at the global scope level. A general rule for local scope is that the varying levels are defined by functions. As in the local scope of function is what is written inside that particular function but not the action of the function itself. However, there is a 'scope chain' in that you can have a local scope within a function and if you have function inside that function you create an inner layer of scope. All very confusing.
