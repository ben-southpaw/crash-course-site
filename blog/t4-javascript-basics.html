 <h3>How does JavaScript compare to HTML and CSS?</h3>
    <p style= "color: black;">While it might be possible to create a website using only one or two of these languages there are a number of reasons why combining is the best idea. HTML is best used for the shape and content of the pages while CSS is best suited to styling the content. JavaScript provides any dynamic or interactive features, whcih could include forms to be filled in or video content or anything that happens in 'real time'. That is doesnt require you to hit refresh on the browser. So essentially anything that happens once a page is loaded probably due to the JavaScript coding of the website.

<h3>What are loops and control flow?</h3>
    <p style="color: black;"> In JavaScript, and most other languages, the 'control flow' refers to a series of statments in the code that dictate what operations are supposed to occur. The code usually represents a pretty straight forward instruction i.e. "Do this thing, then this one!". But sometimes we need the code to respond to input from the person using the website, such as the answering of a question. Here the control flow can employ options so that the page can be responsive. What is worthy of a reminder though, is that like in everyday situations we can only operate within our limits. So when given parameters there are things we can do and things we can't. JavaScript operates like this, so that given a situation only so many things are operable or possible. Loops are pieces of code that repeat themselves based on their instructions until ordered to stop. These are useful for searching through data or other bits of code and can operate in a number of useful ways within a program. A real life example of a loop could be how we teach kids to cross a busy road. If the child had software you would tell it to implement a function of looking left and right to view the traffic. This function should loop until the traffic is no longer visible, thus breaking the loop. This may lead to another action or in this case our robo-child may now safely cross.</p>

<h3>What's the difference between accessing data from arrays and object literals?</h3>
  <p style="color: black;">An array is a list of features or data from a piece of code. If we have a category or part of our site that expands and needs to be manipulated, such as a list of names or numbers an array houses this data. Object literals however, refer to code that features an object that has defining features or characteristics. So if we have a purple Mercedes and we want to define it, our object would suggest the following: as a variable we refer to it as a car, while the colour feature equals purple and the make features equals Mercedes. Object literals present a tidier way of storing this kind of data within our code.</p>

<h3>What are functions and why are they useful?</h3>
    <p style="color: black;">Functions can be thought of mini programs with our larger program or code. They operate to execute a function when needed or called and save time from having to repeat code across the entire layout of our code. Moreover, a function is best utilised to perform a particular task such as searching a section of data for another piece of code or prompting a question at certain points. Overall, functions are the smaller building blocks that help build the wall.</p>
