 <h3>What is grid based design?</h3>
    <p style= "color: black;">A grid based design is what the name suggests. Using a grid to map out features of a website leads to the creation of ordered hierarchies and common-sense visual links that are easy to follow. Having information in columns and across different levels means a large amount of content can be viewed in a reasonably insignificant area.

<h3>What's the hype around responsive webpages?</h3>
    <p style="color: black;"> Responsive webpages are those which are highly adaptable across devices. This means the frames and boxes, which hold the content, require very little adjusting when loading despite differing pixel sizes. To be visually appealing a responsive page is likely to hold similar proportions despite the changing screens the content is being projected to. The hype responsible is due to the evolving technology in terms of how we view online content. With smaller devices being as prevalent as desktop monitors.</p>

<h3>Semantic structure</h3>
  <p style="color: black;">The semantic structuring of HTML is used as an index form for identifying the type of content. This is useful for developers to assess how a site is modelled but also useful as an understanding of newly developed functions can be shared and understood more easily. While it is generally useful to parse items semantically for organisation, the potential to use semantic tags as a form of indexing the internet has been around a while but appears too flawed to gain much traction.</p>

<h3>What else?</h3>
    <p style="color: black;">Learning about media queries was great to understand how responsive design principles are implemented. Also how CSS normalise makes it pretty simple. Along with design easing features like placehold.it and Google fonts, there was a lot of handy hints to pick up this week!</p>
