 <h3>What learnings did you take from the chapter?</h3>
    <p style= "color: black;">Firstly the chapter touched on how emotional regulation is often more down to choice than is often realised. Also that self-regulation is about skillfully accepting and not repressing emotions, as these reflect potentially valuable information. 

    Another section of the chapter focussed on how there is a difference between pain and suffering. The sensation of pain would only be connected to suffering because we naturally associate the two but it doesn't have to be this way. Furthermore, when positive emotions occur, there is a common feeling that once they end this is a bad thing. The newly experienced absence of pleasure. However by disconnecting this with self-regulation we have the potential to enjoy positive emotion more fully.

<h3>How did you find the two minutes of mindfulness?</h3>

<h3>Braces {}</h3>
  <p style="color: black;">Bring up negative emotion was difficult to properly do at first but once I had repeated it a few times the exercise got easier. The Siberian North Railroad technique was quite effective. I think the theory of mind part, by understanding the perspective of another who is causing the trouble is especially difficult but makes an especially valuable skill.</p>
