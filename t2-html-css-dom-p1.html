 <h3>What is DOM?</h3>
    <p style= "color: black;">In order to describe HTML, I would say, that it provides the skeleton of a webpage. The bones of the layout leaving room for potential things to be added and to surround these structures. CSS adds depth and design to the structures layed out by HTML. Together they act as instructions to be interpreted by a browser. Once a browser has interpreted and acted on the code provided the DOM is displayed. While this could be identical in look to the HTML it's the reflection of what the browser did with the instructions provided.
    </p>

<h3>Boxifying design?</h3>
    <p style="color: black;">Despite the capabilities of producing multiple shapes on a website, everything is in boxes. However, these boxes know no borders so boxes may overlap and be of any size. This is useful when designing an initial outlay. Any text, image, object or dynamic feature of a website can fit into a box or a multitude of boxes.

<h3>More on the Box Model</h3>
  <p style="color: black;">CSS also relies on a box model. Each box presented via HTML features four CSS elements, the margins, borders, padding and content. These elements are represented in order from the surrounding to the centre of the box, with the content being central.</p>
