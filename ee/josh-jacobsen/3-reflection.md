1) What did I do well this week?
I got to the point this week that I feel like I'm getting to know a bit more of what I don't know with CSS. By that I mean that if I hit a snag, I had no idea of how to resolve it. I'm now starting to find more and more that when something isn't working, I kind of know the ball park in which to look (or I know in which haystack to look for the needle, to provide another analogy).


2) What could I have done to improve?
I would definitly have benefited from staying foucsed on the course material and not wandering down so many rabbit holes. I didn't stay on track as well as I could have this week, and while it is interesting and I learn a lot, it has led me to be working late on a Sunday trying to get stuff in before a deadline (which is something that I really don't enjoy doing; I try to ensure that I have everything done and submitted well in advance of any deadlines).
