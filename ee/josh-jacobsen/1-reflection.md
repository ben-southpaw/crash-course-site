1) Why is reflection important? 
Research has shown that lessons are drawn from experience only if that experience is then reflected upon. Reflecting on our experiences allows us to distill the points that we need to improve on for next time, as well as identify and celebrate the things that we did well

2) What did I do well this week?
Getting stuck in to the material as soon as I was able was a good point. 

Another thing I did well was to work through possible solutions to problems when I hit a snag, and not to get too frustrated when things were not working out. 

3) What could I have done to improve?
I could have been better about going over all the course materials before heading off and starting on the assignments. Even when I think I know something, I still need to work through the material to ensure that I'm covering everything. There were a couple of occasions when I spent a great deal of time looking for the answer to a problem, when the solution was contained in course material that I had not yet looked at.
