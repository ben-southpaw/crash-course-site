What did I do well this week?

-I didn't compare myself to others so much. This is, however, still a 'work in progress'. <br> 
-I didn't get too disheartened when things weren't going to plan. <br>
-When I was feeling disconnected I reached out to my cohort and got together with a fellow student to code. 

What could I have done to improve?

-I didn't spend enough time with the skeleton resource. I understood the column part of it but didn't fully grasp the importance of 'row' until the very end of the week. This probably would have saved me quite a bit of time but it is all part of the learning process. <br>
-The short week also had me feeling the pressure. I needed to relax more and go with the flow.
