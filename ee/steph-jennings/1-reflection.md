Why is reflection important?

As one of the resources said "Reflection is a key ingredient to move knowledge from short term to long term memory." We cannot fully learn the lessons that experience teaches us unless we take the time to think about what worked, what didn't and why. When we reflect we can pin point small changes that need to be made. When we see ourselves make improvements, even if they are incremental, is a powerful motivational booster. Whether we go forward or backward in our work can affect our mood. Reflection provides perspective and room to grow.  


What did I do well this week?

-I read/watched all the information in the resources and got a good grasp of what needed to be learnt and then put in into practice. 
-My focus and time management went well with Toggl providing my mind with the fact of how long I had been working rather than my mind just going on how long I felt I had been working which is not very accurate.
-I adopted the idea of piggy-backing a new habit onto an old habit. I had being doing this a little before reading the resources but not consciously. Now that it is in the forefront of my mind I am able to maximise the behaviour and control it. 


What could I have done to improve?

-Asked for help more quickly when I got blocked when I wasn't saving each subl doc in the repo and so not all the changes were getting through to Github. I probably wouldn't have been able to figure that out on my own. 
-Looked at the assignments first to gage what was most important/read them carefully and started earlier on shortcutfoo. I was too hung up on getting my typing faster when I didn't need to and so I was practicing the wrong skill.
