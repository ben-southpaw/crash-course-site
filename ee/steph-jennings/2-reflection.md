What did I do well this week?

-I managed my time really well and got through the assignments in good time so that I can go away for the long weekend and not worry about being behind. <br>
-I learnt some really helpful quick-keys for subl in a article I read. Most importantly the Shift-Alt-Up-2 to make 2 columns so that I can look at my css at the same time as the HTML. <br>
-I make my webpage look a lot more stylie with background images.

What could I have done to improve?

-I was a little too focused on the assignments and didn't even notice that I hadn't looked at the resources for the tidying assignment except to skim them at the beginning of the week. Luckily I had googled a query and got to the same resource. <br>
-I will need to go back and look at a few of the resources again to make sure I didn't miss anything important. <br>
-I didn't do very well on implementing my meditation habit. I will have to work on it more. <br>
-I need to make notes as I work of what is going well and what isn't. When I get to the end of the week everything feels like it has gone in a blur.
