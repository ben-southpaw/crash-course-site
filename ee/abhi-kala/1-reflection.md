Why is reflection important?
Reflection is important because it enables you to step out of action mode momentarily and consciously look at the outcomes that have been produced so far. Any given project should consist of reflection cycles to assess the direction of the project. Reflection gives us the opportunity to reflect on the current project, the approach taken to it, and on its relation to past projects. Doing so creates an opportunity to improve the outcome and the processes as the project moves forward.

What did I do well this week ?
I am happy using the command line and Github so I would say that is what I did well this week. I accepted command line and Github into my life.

What could I have done to improve?
I need to religiously dedicate a block of time every day for this course. The first week was a good eye opener in that respect, it gave us the glimpse of the intensity of this course. Loving it.
