Why is reflection important?

Information is more efficiantly memorised, along with a greater depth of learning.

What did I do well this week?

Not a whole lot, poor time management but did however, upon reflection learn what-not-to-do!

What could I have done to improve?

A better understanding of what the tasks were and possibly asked for more help. Given the extra time I then would have been able to reflect on the learnings as well.
