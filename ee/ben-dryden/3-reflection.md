What did I do well this week?

Not a whole lot, fell behind a bit this week but that being said, I feel like I am learning and had some success and am getting used to various programs and terms quite quickly. Also I feel like switching to the new cohort was a positive and that I have been more vocal already!

What could I have done to improve?

Once again time management was a major issue. Being away for the last 3.5 days in the south island due to family commitment was a major distraction and has made it difficult to re-focus when I did engage in the work. Also the typing practice and mindfulness also took a back-seat which was bad. But looking forward to improving and finding more confidence next week.
