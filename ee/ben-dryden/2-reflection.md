What did I do well this week?

I felt I did well with re-arranging my CSS structures and picked up a lot of new info. I spent a lot of time on the assignments, lessons and readings. One thing that worked better this week than last was jumping around the assignments in the sprint. Often when stuck ill stick to the issue to try resolve it but this causes frustration so moving onto the next thing helped a couple times.

What could I have done to improve?

Time management is still an issue thats slightly out of my control. I could however, have asked for more help from my cohort and used Pomodoro more effectively. Finding more time in the week to get long stints in would be best however.
