Sprint 1 reflection


Why is reflection important?
Expert planners and skilled time managers always plan a weekly slot to reflect. I hope to actually make some time for myself and plan a regular time to make it a habit without lifestyle interruptions. Reflecting on what has been learned should help us be more productive as we use experiences already gained.

What did I do well this week?
Finding different places and ways to use wifi whilst on holiday and working at whatever I could when I could. Sorting some technical issues on Git Hub that were holding me back from pushing work up.

What could I have done to improve?
Doing more prep work before the course started. Not going away in the first two weeks!
