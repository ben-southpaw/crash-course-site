Why is reflection important?

John Dewey once said, "We do not learn from experience, we learn on reflecting from experience". I believe this whole heartedly and agree with Dewey. I find reflecting on experience to be somewhat of a hobby nowadays, improving my understanding on complex problems. It works in mysterious ways this "reflecting" thing. It seems to jolt you in the middle of the night when you just can't put yourself to sleep overworked by this huge burden of a problem when suddenly, a solution whisks in and around your mind forming this "ah ha" moment. That's when I knew... This reflecting thing... it's bloody good mate. 

What did I do well this week?

	You know what! I think I did well in engaging with my fellow cohorts and teachers. I say this because I am one to just peruse the web sitting on the sideline never really asking for help or engaging in any conversations but I kinda said "f" it. I am not paying all this money to be in the same position as I was last month. That was what ultimately led me here. Those pesky questions! I have still yet to the master the art of asking, (terrible book by the way, just my two cents).
	
What could I have done to improve?

	I believe that I could have read the material more precisely to understand the assignments a little better. I have this annoying habit of doing the complicated things first without reading exactly what to do. I guess trying to learn on my own with nobody overseeing my work has led to me adopting these bad habits. Anyway, whoever is reading this. Help me!
	Oh and one more thing. I have been super slack on using this toggle timer. I find it quite annoying honestly. It put's this frustrating idea in my head that if the timer is on, I get more anxious to complete the task faster, resulting in sloppy work. Now I am far from a perfectionist, but darn it I just want to get the work done right the first time. Anyway, I guess I can somehow "improve" in my usage of this damned tool.
