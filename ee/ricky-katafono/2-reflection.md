What did I do well this week?

I am glad that I managed to push myself to do finish the tasks. I will admit that inspiration levels were a bit low this week. This was due to a lot of things popping up taking away my time. I hope to come back with full force next week to give myself extra cushion to actually absorb some of the concepts and I guess, reflect on them.

 What could I have done to improve?

I really wanted to structure my day to complete the tasks a bit earlier in the week. That way I could have read the assignments properly and actually take my time to do it right. What I will do now is take the time to go back into the udacity videos, especially the video on CSS layouts. I really want to improve my website layout as well as add subcategories for my blogs. I initially had the idea of having all the blogs on one page then having tags on the top of the page jump to the requested blog post but I feel that's more to do with the back-end (not sure about this). I will however focus on my layout in the meantime adding some flex properties and media queries.
