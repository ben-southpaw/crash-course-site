#Reflection - Week 3

###What did I do well this week?
I'm incredibly proud of finishing everything this week despite my initial fears about getting it all completed. 

###What could I have done to improve?
Process over product - I need to learn to cope with this better. I really struggle with producing something I'm not proud of. I need to remember that I'm learning and it's better to spend more time on the concept resources and on actually learning how to use different techniques.  
Time-boxing - I've got a bad habit of going over the time I've set aside for each task. Sticking to process over product would help me with my time boxing problems.  
I think I would have learnt more if I had started off with an even simpler wireframe.
